## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- A Live Server extension (like the one in VS Code)

## Setup & Run

1. Open the project folder in your code editor.
2. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **"Open with Live Server"**  
   _(or just use your editor's Live Server extension to launch it)_.
3. The game will open in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` (or similar).
4. It takes about 20 seconds to load so be patient.
